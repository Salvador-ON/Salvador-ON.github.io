## About Me

I'm a Mechatronic Engineer with 5 years of experience in the tech field.

In 2020 I decided to follow my dreams as a Developer. I graduated from Microverse Full-Stack Software Development Program, where I learned HTML, CSS, Ruby, Rails, JavaScript, React, and Redux.

During this program I honed my remote working skills, I have more than 1000 hours of remote work with colleagues from other parts of the world.

One of my favorite parts of coding is the ability to use code for helping and making a difference in peopleâ€™s lives. Making tasks easier and quicker to do.
